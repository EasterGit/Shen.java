# 神.java | Shen for Java

http://shenlanguage.org/

Shen is a portable functional programming language by [Mark Tarver](http://www.lambdassociates.org/) that offers

* pattern matching,
* λ calculus consistency,
* macros,
* optional lazy evaluation,
* static type checking,
* an integrated fully functional Prolog,
* and an inbuilt compiler-compiler.

## This Java Port

Is a work in progress - it really doesn't work yet. The main [Shen JVM port](https://www.assembla.com/code/shen-on-java/git/nodes) is done by Joel Shellman and might be used for [Babel](http://www.shenlanguage.org/babel/babel.htm), Mark's IDE project.

It's loosely based on [`shen.clj`](https://github.com/hraberg/shen.clj), but has no dependency on Clojure.
Started as an [interpreter](https://github.com/hraberg/Shen.java/blob/master/src/shen/Shen.java) using [MethodHandles](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle.html) as a primitive.
This is pretty experimental, and this entire project acts as a playground for various JDK 8 and JVM language stuff.

The idea is to compile this down to bytecode eventually. Note that I don't vouch for any of the implementation details regarding this - I'm learning as we go.
All code lives in [`Shen.java`](https://github.com/hraberg/Shen.java/blob/master/src/shen/Shen.java).

There's an IntelliJ project, which requires [IDEA 12](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) and [JDK 8 with Lambda support](http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/). It's based on this [Maven project](https://github.com/hraberg/Shen.java/blob/master/pom.xml).


### Building

    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk1.8.0/with/lambdas
    mvn package
    $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar target/shen.java-*-standalone.jar


### What works?

* The K Lambda parser.
* KL special forms.
* Partial application.
* Implicit recur.
* Simple Java inter-op (based on Clojure's syntax).
* [Dominik's tests](https://github.com/hraberg/Shen.java/blob/master/test/shen/ShenTest.java) from [Shen to Clojure](http://code.google.com/p/shen-to-clojure/).


### Road Map

This is bound to change as we go:

* Full KL compilation.
* Ability to load the `kl`.
* The REPL
* The Shen test suite.
* SwitchPoints for symbols.
* Saner choice of target method.
* Different bootstrap methods for invoke, apply and value/set.
* Proper arithmetic.
* Pre-compilation of the `kl` to `.class` files.
* Ad-herence to Shen types when compiling typed Shen.
* Performance.

[Scheme in one class](https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/scheme_in_one_class) (Rose, 2010) - Parts of this looks pretty similar actually! Slightly more advanced/complex, has Java interop but no lambdas. Haven't been updated from the older java.dyn package. "semi-compiled" to MHs, no ASM used.

[Runtime metaprogramming via java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~magarcia/ScalaCompilerCornerReloaded/2012Q2/RuntimeMP.pdf) (Garcia, 2012) - The idea of building the AST from MethodHandles without using ASM did occur to me, and looks like it could be possible. Not sure you can actually create a fn definition though (see above). Did a spike, doesn't seem easy/worth the hassle, may revisit.
